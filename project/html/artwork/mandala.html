        Mandala is the Sanskrit word for "circle", however in art it is referred to a geometric collection of shapes to
        form
        a gorgeous
        set of patterns. The mandala traces its origins from Hindu and Buddhist texts and has uses such as a reference
        point
        for the individual to center their
        spirit not only in the process of mediation, but as a means of living their life free from negative energy.
        Mandalas
        are also used
        to display the endless process of life, death and rebirth on the outside, with usually the image of a deity or
        other
        universal realms in the centre.
        Today, mandalas are commonly associated with Western New Age culture and can be observed in architecture. The
        "dotwork" style of tattooing uses the foundation of the Mandala
        outside and inside section to create a symmetrical or semi-symmetrical pattern of circles and shapes, which are
        meant to represent peace and balance.
        The Mandala is the first piece of artwork I have attempted to recreate. I have chosen the mandala due to my
        fascination with geometric patterns, and
        its meaning in my life as I am a practitioner Buddhist. Below, the user has the opportunity to use a scroll to
        add
        or subtract points of contact on
        the canvas to simplify or add further complexity to the Mandala. The user is also free to animate the mandala
        and to
        change the color of the lines.
