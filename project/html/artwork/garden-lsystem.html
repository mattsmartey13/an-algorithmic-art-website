<section class="page-content">
    <p class="page-description">
        For my second art piece, I have drawn inspiration from "The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants" to allow the user to
        create a garden from L-system algorithms.
        Unlike the fractal builder where the user is free to play with the algorithm, here the user cannot input on the
        L-system language, and is only permitted to choose the type of entity to draw.
    </p>
    <p class="page-description">
        As the user does not have any input on the algorithm, I have devised an L-system constructor that will generate
        a string semi-randomly. For
        entities such as the tree, you might be given a tree with no branches or a tree with multiple. It might be
        straight, it might curve or even collapse to the ground.
        The cloud might be circular or more linear.
    </p>
    <p class="page-description">
        To draw, establish the soil and grass layer, then select a type below and left-click on the canvas where you
        want to draw it. This will be the coordinate for the
        bottom of the trunk/stem. For clouds, this will be the leftmost point of where you want your cloud to be.
        Note that after resetting the canvas, you do not need to reestablish the soil layer again.
