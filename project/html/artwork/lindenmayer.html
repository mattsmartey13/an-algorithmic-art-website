        L-systems are a type of algorithm used to create complex shapes and patterns using a simple "alphabet" ruleset.
        <br>
        This was proposed by biologist Aristid Lindenmayer to explain the nature of plants and their algorithmic beauty.
        <br>
        Computer scientists have taken his ideas to explain the creation of formal languages using a finite alphabet.
        <br>

        Below you will see my inspiration for my focus on L-systems in this project.
