        L-systems are a type of algorithm used to create complex shapes and patterns using a simple "alphabet" ruleset.
        This was proposed by biologist Aristid Lindenmayer to explain the nature of plant and cell growth.
        Computer scientists have taken his ideas to explain the creation of formal languages using a finite alphabet.

    <p class="page-description">
        Plainly speaking, the structure of this particular L-system tree is to draw a line and then split into two. The
        splitting into
        two branches is a recursive mechanism: while there is a specific condition in place (in this instance, the line
        length is above 15),
        the function will call itself over and over again (draw a line, mark the end coordinate of the line, split into
        two, shrink the line length).
        Once the line length is equal to or below 15, the branching mechanism will stop and the pink leaves will be
        created.
    </p>
    <p class="page-description">
        The "self-similarity" of L-systems is most apparent when looking at a tree. The branch is just a smaller version
        of a tree.
        To look at it on an even smaller scale, we can see there is a branching mechanism in a stem where leaves spawn,
        and even in the leaf vein structure.
