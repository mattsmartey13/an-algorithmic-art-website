# An Algorithmic Art Website

## Hello and welcome to my final year project for my Computer Science degree.

This algorithmic art is canvas based, with a primary focus on Lindenmayer systems (L-systems). 
The art itself is in a functional programing style.

Following the 17th May when my university degree is complete, I will continue to add to this project in my own time.
Stay tuned for more artwork, and a better frontend appearance!
