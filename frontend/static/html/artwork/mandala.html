<h1>Mandala</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    Mandala is the Sanskrit word for "circle", however in art it is referred to a geometric collection of shapes to form a gorgeous
    <br>
    set of patterns. The mandala traces its origins from Hindu and Buddhist texts and has uses such as a reference point for the individual to center their
    <br>
    spirit not only in the process of mediation, but as a means of living their life free from negative energy. Mandalas are also used
    <br>
    to display the endless process of life, death and rebirth on the outside, with usually the image of a deity or other universal realms in the centre.
    <br>
    Today, mandalas are commonly associated with Western New Age culture and can be observed in architecture. The "dotwork" style of tattooing uses the foundation of the Mandala
    <br>
    outside and inside section to create a symmetrical or semi-symmetrical pattern of circles and shapes, which are meant to represent peace and balance.

    The Mandala is the first piece of artwork I have attempted to recreate. I have chosen the mandala due to my fascination with geometric patterns, and
    <br>
    its meaning in my life as I am a practitioning Buddhist. Below, the user has the opportunity to use a scroll to add or subtract points of contact on
    <br>
    the canvas to simplify or add further complexity to the Mandala. The user is also free to experiment with the background color and to change the color
    <br>
    of the mandala itself.
